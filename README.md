# cohort7_structure

## Introduction
In the last 6 cohorts, we have offered free machine learning classes to more than 600 Nigerians and we are excited to continue our long-standing tradition. However, in this cohort, we will be introducing our students to Machine Learning operations (MLOPS) tools in the hope of better preparing them for their future work in the field Machine Learning. This document will serve as a guideline for our students, as well as other communities looking to replicate the AI Saturdays Lagos model ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Cohort 7
- 15 weeks of Main class and 1 week break üòé
- 10 practicals with MLOPS
- 1 Main project
- Certificate of participation if all the requirements are fulfiled (more details below)
## Subgroups
**Team Lead:** Teams leads are software engineers or who have some degree of software engineering skills that can be leveraged across all members of their team. The function of the team lead would be to teach the students peripheral software skills like using Github, command line, debugging, etc. The team leads will report to the team mentor.

**Team Scrum Master:** The function of the scrum master is to lead team meetings and help keep meeting times.

**Team PM:** The team project manager helps monitor and assign team's task on notion.

**Team Ninjas** The team ninjas (preferably a backend and frontend developers) would help the team with any frontend and backend development tasks for the team's project.

**Team Secretary:** The secretary helps the team to monitor some key metrics such as attendance turnout rate, and help prepare team monthly presentations.


## Team Responsibilities
**Weekly Meetings:** Each team is encouraged to have a weekly meeting for the purpose of working through the task or learning peripheral software skills like how to use Github, command line, etc, together. 

**Practical Tasks:** Each team is expected to work through practical tasks together. Tasks would be shared through a notion template documents which can be duplicated by different teams.

**Montly Meetings with Team Leads:** Each team mentor will facilitate and meet monthly with the team leads to discuss progress and get update on the team statistics. 

**Team Github Repository:** Each team is expected to create a Github repository for their team under AI Saturdays Lagos Github organization, where each member would complete and contribute to the tasks.

## Curriculum
We will primarily be using the three fantastic courses listed below. However, each volunteer course instructor has full autonomy in choosing which materials to use to teach their classes.

1. [CMU Data Science Course](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/lectures/) 
2. [Machine Learning @ VU University Amsterdam](https://mlvu.github.io/)
3. [Stanford Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-spring2021.html)
